# Termux Convient Started Script , And Auto Dark Support
Did't achieve

For a little more convient,use ZeroTermux.dev,but non-Chinese support bad

**Default no SHIFT,and can't copy better to Android,f**k**

(no way use shorcut to Android,long press to copy hard to got long text)

Install some perfect software for only-bash Termux,and try to add Auto Dark feature
